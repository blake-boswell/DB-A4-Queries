-- Q1
-- Find the trips for which the departure date is a Friday.  For each such trip, print the corresponding employee name, 
-- day of departure and day of return both spelled out completely, 
-- and number of days between the departure and return

-- Q3
-- For all the receipts that were submitted in 2017, print the total amount for each expense type.  
-- The expense type must be spelled out rather than printing "T" or "H" or "M".  That is, 
-- print the total "Transportation" cost, total "Hotel" cost, and total "Meals" cost incurred in 2017.

-- Q4
-- For every employee show the total number of trips he/she has taken.

-- Q5
-- Assume that receipts are due within 10 days of completion of a trip.  For example, if an employee returned from a trip on March 17, 2018, 
-- he/she must submit the receipts by March 27, 2018.  Create a view titled "Defaulters" that shows the employee name, the return date,
